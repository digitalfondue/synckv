- add a distributed get, in case the sync has currently not be done
- add a distributed put for reducing the amount of full sync
- sync improvement: for reducing the traffic: check if we can do it in a more structured way through the leader
  - add a full check as BloomFilters may provide false positive, sometimes, from time to time broadcast a set of {table [{key,hash}]}
    could be done by the leader, it could be done if all the table are synced correctly
- convert to java logging :Â°)
