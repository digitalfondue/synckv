- cleanup, documentation, tests, ... ?
- add a more structured data support so we can build some kind of query system over it
- add a more strong sync guarantee...
- programmatic configuration of the JGroups channel: http://belaban.blogspot.com/2010/10/programmatic-creation-of-channel.html
- for the better sync guarantee: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/51423/how-do-you-create-a-merkle-tree-that-lets-you-insert-and-delete-elements-without/52811#52811
    - for insertion order, hash-> truncate to last 8(?) bit
        - leaf node -> contain a sortedtree


    - binary trie with a merkle tree twist: at initialization: define depth for creating the whole empty tree + hash function.
        -> add insertion function + boolean for updating hash
        -> add an update hash function for updating the whole tree -> useful for bulk insert

- clock skew detection

- true p2p sync? Currently it's coordinated by the leader, but in theory, everybody could simply select another node to check if there is a need to sync
