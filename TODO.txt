- cleanup, documentation, tests, ... ?
- clock skew detection
- duplicate key insertion detection
- garbage collector for old keys/value ?
    - simple: we could simply remove the value of the old key locally (after a put) the "history" length could be an option.
    - more difficult: find a way to safely remove the old key too.
- sync statistics
   - [table, key received count, last received]
   . [table, key sent count, last sent]
